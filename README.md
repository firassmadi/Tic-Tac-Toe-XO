### **Gameplay Mechanics**
1. **Players**:
   - Two players take turns.
   - One player uses **X**, and the other uses **O**.

2. Objective:
   - To be the first player to place three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row on the grid.

3. Rules:
   - The game is played on a 3x3 grid (larger grids like 4x4 or 5x5 are used in variations).
   - Players alternate turns, placing their symbol (X or O) in an empty square.
   - The first player to align three of their symbols in a row wins.
   - If all squares are filled and no player has achieved the objective, the game ends in a draw.
